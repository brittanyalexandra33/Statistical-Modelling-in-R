Any moment now, unfortunately!\n(Give or take 1000 years or so).\n\nA volcano could happen this afternoon, or it might not happen for\nanother 1000 years. Volcanoes are almost impossible to predict; they\nseem to happen completely at random.\n\nHowever, we do know of a statistical distribution that counts the number\nof events in a fixed space of time...the Poisson distribution! The\nPoisson process counts the number of events occurring in a fixed time or\nspace, when events occur independently and at a constant average rate,\nwhere the formula for our statistical model is as follows:\n\n$Y_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\mu_i),$ where $\\mu_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i\\quad$\n\nDiving a bit into understanding the foundations of how we will use this\nstatistical model in R... It is worth noting that we need to use a link\nfunction to map our parameter of interest, $\\mu_i$ , to the real number\nline, where $log(\\mu_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i$.\n\nIn other words, the expected value of our response variable, $\\mu_i$,\nmust be non negative $(\\mu_i\\ ≥ 0)$. However, because we are using a\nlog-link function, the model actually estimates $\\log(\\mu_i)$ which can\ntake on any real number, that is $- \\infty < \\log(\\mu_i) < +\\infty$\n\n\nToday, we will look at how to use the poisson distribution to model the\noccurrence of volcanic events per year in Country A. This country is\ncomposed of smaller areas that regularly record information on the\nfollowing:\n\n-   area.type: Categorical variable with 9 categories.\n\n-   total.land.area: Total land area in square kms\n\n-   total.area: Total area (including water) in square kms\n\n-   shape.length: Length of the shape of the area in kms\n\n-   UrbanRural: Recoded variable area.type into bigger categories\n\n-   previous.eruption: Number of previous volcanic eruptions in the are\n\n-   Y: Number of eruptions during the observation period. The\n    observation time is ONE\\\n    year for all areas.\n\n-   earthquakes.year: Average number of earthquakes per year in the area\n\nA quick note, *this blog is not focused on the exploratory part of this\ndata, and will not go in-depth to all the metrics and terms used, but I\naim to add another page soon explaining the terminology!*\n\n\n\n\n\n# Step 1. Choosing variables to include in the model\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEach analysis begins with selecting which variables to include in our\nmodel. Contrary to intuition, we do **not** want to include every\nvariable available --- for several key reasons:\n\n-   **Occam's Razor** suggests that, all else equal, simpler models are\n    preferable to more complex ones.\n\n-   Including too many variables can introduce **multicollinearity**,\n    where highly correlated predictors make coefficient estimates\n    unstable and unreliable.\n\n[**The methods to identify appropriate explanatory variables are listed\nbelow (this is specific to our analysis):**]{.underline}\n\n1.  **Domain knowledge:** Always the most important source of insight.\n    **Correlation plots:** Useful for detecting multicollinearity\n    between explanatory variables.\n\n2.  **Chi-square tests:** To test for associations between categorical\n    variables.\n\n3.  **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):** Balances model fit with\n    model complexity to guide selection relative to comparative models.\n\nWe aim to choose explanatory variables that are **strongly associated\nwith the response variable** while avoiding those that are **highly\ncorrelated with each other**. We will walk through choosing appropriate\nvariables to model our response, Y, with an example, focusing on the\nvariables `area.type` and `UrbanRural`\n\nIn the pairs plot below, we can see `area.type` and `UrbanRural`are\nmoderately colinear with a correlation of 0.42 and therefore only one\nshould in the model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npairs20x(data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](poisson_earthquakes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 1.1 Domain Knowledge\n\nIt's important to ask whether there **is a contextual benefit** to\nincluding `area.type` or `UrbanRural`. As we are interested in modelling\nthe frequency of eruptions, and not the impact of specific area types, I\nam unbiased as to which variable we include in the model from a\ncontextual standpoint.\n\n### 1.2 Chi-square Tests\n\nAs established by our pairs plot, it looks like we face a few colinear\nvariables, and we are interested in looking into `UrbanRural` and\n`area.type`.\n\nWe can test the hypothesis that they both variables contain similar\ninformation using a chi-square test. This test **checks for a\nstatistically significant association between two categorical\nvariables**, with the null hypothesis being that there is there is no\nassociation between two categorical variables.\n\n$$\nH_0: \\text{The two categorical variables are independent.}\n$$\n\nBelow, we can see the test result has a small p-value of 0.0005, thus\nshowing **no evidence to reject the null hypothesis** --- suggesting\nthat the distribution of `UrbanRural` and `area.type` categories is\nlikely due to chance, and they are **not significantly different**.\n\nGiven `area.type` and `UrbanRural` are not statistically different, and\nthey have eight anad three levels, respectively, we will opt for the\nsimpler explanatory variable with three levels, `UrbanRural`.\n\nWhy do we want to **reduce our model complexity?** Well, **simpler\nmodels are easier to interpret when we are quantifying their impact on\nthe response**. Remember, this is statistical modelling NOT machine\nlearning. We need to be able to explain every part going on, and the\neffect each variable has on the result.\n\nFrom a computational standpoint, it enables a faster convergence of\nmodels, allows parameter coefficients to be more stable, and helps\navoids overfitting.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n # We can see that we have a small p-value of 0.00049 (p-val < 0.05), therefore have no evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the observed distribution difference across the categories 'UrbanRural` and `area.type` is due to chance \ntabledata <- table(data$UrbanRural, data$area.type)\nchiResult <- chisq.test(tabledata, simulate.p.value = TRUE, B = 2000)\n\n# Clean summary\ncat(\"Chi-squared test (with simulated p-value, B = 2000):\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nChi-squared test (with simulated p-value, B = 2000):\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat(\"X-squared =\", round(chiResult$statistic, 3), \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nX-squared = 37478 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat(\"Degrees of freedom =\", chiResult$parameter, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nDegrees of freedom = NA \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat(\"P-value =\", format.pval(chiResult$p.value, digits = 4, eps = 1e-4), \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nP-value = 0.0004998 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 1.3 AIC\n\nAIC is a likelihood based metric often used to compare two statistical\nmodels. A lower AIC is favourable to a higher AIC, as it indicates a\nbetter blend of model complexity while still explaining the data well.\n\nIt's important to note that **there is no single \"correct\" way to choose\nvariables**. For instance, `UrbanRural` has a slightly higher AIC\n(253157) than `area.type` (253043), but the difference is marginal and\nin my personal opinion, not worth incorporating into the model due to\nits additional levels. (UrbanRural has 3 levels while area.type has 5).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel1 <- glm(Y ~ UrbanRural, family = \"poisson\", data = data)\nmodel2 <- glm(Y ~ area.type, family = \"poisson\", data = data)\n\n# Create comparison data frame\ncomparison <- data.frame(\n  Model = c(\"UrbanRural\", \"Area Type\"),\n  AIC = c(AIC(model1), AIC(model2)))\n\n# Pretty table\ncomparison %>%\n  kable(\"html\", caption = \"<strong> Model Comparison: AIC </strong>\") %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\"), \n                full_width = FALSE, \n                position = \"center\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover table-condensed table-responsive\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption><strong> Model Comparison: AIC </strong></caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Model </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> AIC </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> UrbanRural </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 253157.0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Area Type </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 253042.8 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLastly, our plots indicate both variables follow similar distribution\npatterns. The effect of `Sea`, which only has three observations, is\nnegligible and including it would risk biasing our model due to its\nhigher proportion of earthquakes, but smaller sample size.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# Ensure categorical variables are factors\ndata <- data %>%\n  mutate(\n    UrbanRural = factor(UrbanRural),\n    area.type = factor(area.type)\n  )\n\n# --- Add counts directly to data frame ---\ndata_urban <- data %>%\n  group_by(UrbanRural) %>%\n  mutate(n = n()) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\ndata_area <- data %>%\n  group_by(area.type) %>%\n  mutate(n = n()) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# --- Plot for UrbanRural ---\np1 <- ggplot(data_urban, aes(x = UrbanRural, y = Y)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightpink\") +\n  stat_summary(\n    fun = max, geom = \"text\",\n    aes(label = paste0(\"n = \", n)),\n    vjust = -0.5, size = 3\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Earthquakes per Urban/Rural Area\",\n    x = \"UrbanRural\",\n    y = \"Earthquakes per Year\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# --- Plot for area.type ---\np2 <- ggplot(data_area, aes(x = area.type, y = Y)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  stat_summary(\n    fun = max, geom = \"text\",\n    aes(label = paste0(\"n = \", n)),\n    vjust = -0.5, size = 3\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Earthquakes per Area Type\",\n    x = \"Area Type\",\n    y = \"Earthquakes per Year\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n# --- Combine plots side by side ---\np1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](poisson_earthquakes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](poisson_earthquakes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-2.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Step 2: Fitting the model\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGiven that the response variable, Y, represents a count of discrete\npositive numbers, we have chosen to apply a generalized linear model\nthat utilities a Poisson distribution to predict Y, the frequency of\neruptions.\n\nTo convert the expected average count of eruptions, denoted as µi, from\nthe Poisson distribution into a linear predictor, we have used the **log\nlink function**. This is because we must ensure all expected values are\ngreater than 0 (our model should not output an expected negative amount\nof earthquakes!), account for non constant variance, and assume a\ndiscrete responses (we can't have 2.5 earthquakes either! what would\nhalf an earthquake mean?)\n\nWe have used explanatory variables; `previous.eruption`, `UrbanRural`,\n`earthquakes.year`, and `total.area`. All explanatory variables had\nsignificant contributions towards explaining model variance (pval :\n\\<2e-16).\n\nWe will initially fit a model with all the variables and see which is\nthe optimal outcome based on which model has the lowest AIC, thereby\npenalizing model complexity and rewarding goodness of fit. In addition,\nWe iteratively removed insignificant variables each model to final\nconverge on glm_model4, which had the (subjectively) best combination of\nlow AIC and low model complexity.\n\nHowever, not all assumptions were not satisfied, as we can see an\nincrease in variance with an increase in the Y (number of eruptions) as\nthe mean increases. If our model was perfect, our predicted values would\nfollow closely to the purple line.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n############################################################\n# Split data into test and training\n############################################################\ntrain_index <- createDataPartition(data$Y, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)\ntrain_data <- data[train_index, ]\ntest_data <- data[-train_index, ]\n\n\n#Fit model with all predictor variables and see what the model tries best with stepwise regression \nglm_model1 <- glm(Y ~ previous.eruption + UrbanRural + shape.length + total.area + total.land.area + earthquakes.year, family = \"poisson\", data = train_data)\n#summary(glm_model1)\n\nglm_model2 <- glm(Y ~ previous.eruption + earthquakes.year + UrbanRural + total.area + shape.length, data = train_data, family = poisson)\n# summary(glm_model2)\n\nglm_model3 <- glm(Y ~ UrbanRural + previous.eruption + earthquakes.year, data = train_data, family = poisson)\n# summary(glm_model3)\n\n# Best model \nglm_model4 <- glm(Y ~ previous.eruption + earthquakes.year + UrbanRural + total.area, family = poisson, data = train_data)\n#summary(glm_model4)\n\n\n# MODEL COMPARISON \n#glm_model3 has the best median between low AIC and low model complexity \nAIC(glm_model1, glm_model2, glm_model3, glm_model4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           df      AIC\nglm_model1  8 147011.3\nglm_model2  7 147015.8\nglm_model3  5 147619.6\nglm_model4  6 147034.7\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npredictions_glm4 <- predict(glm_model4, newdata = test_data, type = \"response\")\ntest_data$predictions_glm4 <- predictions_glm4\n\n# kind of bad model \nggplot(test_data, aes(x = Y, y = predictions_glm4, col = UrbanRural)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = Y, y = Y), color = \"purple\", alpha = 0.5) + # Ideal fit line\n  labs(x = \"Actual\", y = \"Predicted\", title = \"Actual vs. Predicted values from chosen Poisson model \") + \n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](poisson_earthquakes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##############################\n# Fit model with full data now \n##############################\nglm_model3_full <- glm(Y ~ UrbanRural + previous.eruption + earthquakes.year + total.area,\n                 family = \"poisson\", data = data)\n\n# summary(glm_model3_full)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Step 3: Diagnostic checks on our chosen model\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow, we run diagnostic checks on our chosen model\n\n1.

The interaction plot above suggests a difference between the\nexpected number of eruptions depending on how many eruptions there were\nin the previous year (per area) and the average number of eruptions (per\narea).\n\nHence, a poisson model with an interaction term between\nprevious.eruption and earthquakes.year was fit. The interaction term was\nsignificant (pval : \\< 2e-16) so it remained in the model.\n\nAll assumptions were satisfied. However, we still cannot trust the\nresults from the Poisson model (pval: 0 )\n\nHolding all other variables constant...\n\n-   We estimate that, for every 1 unit increase in the number of\n    previous volcanic eruptions (previous.eruptions), the expected\n    number eruptions in a given time period decreases by 63.3%.\n\n    -   This is further decreased by 45.1% for every increase in the\n        average number of earthquakes per year in the area\n        (earthquakes.year)\n\n-   We estimate that, for every 1 unit increase in the number of average\n    earthquakes per year, the expected number of eruptions in a given\n    time period increases by 9.83%.\n\n    -   There is further decreased by 45.1% for every increase the\n        number of previous volcanic eruptions (previous.eruption).\n\n-   We estimate that, for every 1 square km increase in total area, the\n    expected number of eruptions in a given time period increases by\n    1.83%\n\n-   We estimate that the expected number of eruptions in a given time\n    period is 44.97% lower in \"Urban\" (UrbanRural) areas compared to\n    \"Other\" areas\n\n-   We estimate that the expected number of eruptions in a given period\n    is 26.27% higher in \"Settlement\" (UrbanRural) areas compared to\n    \"Other areas\"\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(glm_model5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = Y ~ previous.eruption * earthquakes.year + UrbanRural + \n    total.area, family = poisson, data = data)\n\nDeviance Residuals: \n    Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  \n-6.9849  -2.0430  -0.5682   1.2069   9.8643  \n\nCoefficients:\n                                    Estimate Std.
