A ZIP code tells\nthem where a mail item needs to be delivered. We will look at the\nnumbers 3 and 7 only --- to see if we can distinguish these two numbers\n--- to illustrate ideas about prediction based on logistic regression.\n\nIn this dataset, each hand-written digit is represented as a 16 x 16\narray of pixels.\n\nEach pixel is given a grey-scale value in the range \\[−1, 1\\] with -1\nrepresenting white and 1 representing black. There are thus 16 x 16 =\n256 numbers representing a particular digit, which we can take as the\nvalues of 256 variables, v1, . . . , v256, say\n\n# Step 1: Reading in data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Note: -1 is white and 1 is black \n\ntrain.df <- read.table(\"data/binomial_image/train.txt\")\ntest.df <- read.table(\"data/binomial_image/test.txt\")\n\n# Append D to the dataframe\nnames(train.df) = c(\"D\", paste(\"V\", 1:256, sep=\"\"))\nnames(test.df) = c(\"D\", paste(\"V\", 1:256, sep = \"\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Step 2: View the first 25 samples of handwritten 3s and 7s to identify which are the best at discriminating\n\nHere, we can see cells that would be best at differentiating between a 3\nand 7 are the cells that have most structural difference of white and\nblack space i.e. protruding instances of black colour that are in areas\nunique to that number.\n\nThis can be seen in the following areas of each image:\n\n-   Bottom Cells: It has a very pronounced black curve in the bottom\n    right corner, which forms a loop. This is very contrasting to a 7,\n    which remains open and essentially finishes being black at the\n    bottom right.\n\n-   Middle: The middle of this three is black and extends far from the\n    right to the left of the cell, (almost like a straight line)\n    providing more pronounced differentiation compared to a 7, which\n    does not have this feature in this data set and instead has white\n    area.\n\n-   Top-left: The top of this cell is curved and filled in black, while\n    a 7 in this data set typically has a distinct diagonal black line in\n    the top-left corner.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Set up the plotting area to have a 5x5 grid and minimal margins\npar(mfrow=c(5,5), mar = c(1,1,1,1))\n# Loop through the first 25 rows of the data frame\nfor(k in 1:25){\n  \n  # Convert the k-th row (excluding the first column) into a 16x16 matrix\n  z = matrix(unlist(train.df[k,-1]), 16,16)\n  \n  # Initialize zz as a copy of z\n  zz = z\n  \n    # Mirror the matrix horizontally\n  for(j in 16:1)zz[,j]=z[,17-j]\n  \n  # Plot the mirrored matrix as an image with grayscale colors\n  image(zz, col = gray((32:0)/32))\n  \n  # Add a box around the plot\n  box()\n\n  # Add the value of D in the top-left corner of the plot\n  text(0.1,0.9,train.df$D[k], cex=1.5)\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](binomial_image_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Step 3: Computing the correlation\n\nHere, we will compute the correlation between D and V1, V2,... V256, and\nidentify which of these variables have the highest absolute correlations\n(i.e either very large and negative or very large and positive).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Correlation with D, without D\ncrs=cor(train.df)[,\"D\"][-1]\n\n# Sort absolute values in in decending order\nsort(abs(crs), decreasing=T)[1:20]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     V185      V170      V105      V220      V235      V201      V229      V120 \n0.8714422 0.8331768 0.8208550 0.8144829 0.8053422 0.7994677 0.7824515 0.7795704 \n     V219      V230      V104      V189      V205      V169      V234      V121 \n0.7767427 0.7646643 0.7578159 0.7554507 0.7546277 0.7504911 0.7430652 0.7393237 \n     V204      V186      V173      V221 \n0.7375292 0.7332635 0.7254096 0.6929391 \n```\n:::\n:::\n",
